Wow, so cool so fresh. Many much knowledge! So WOW!

Dav Clark's explanation of why Git is so great:

We start with a working copy, then we add to a staging area. From here we commit the file to a history. Me ringing in here- it's sort of like hopskotch. You start with the file you want to track with git. This is square one. Your end game is to place the file in your tracked history. To get there, you have to go through the staging area. But why the added step? Well, it's a safety step, you can add and rm the file here. In our analogy, we might think we're ready to get to the end square, but we fall flat on our faces. This is no good. But, if we go stepwise by git add, git commit and git push (the pebble approach) it's a better situation all around. From the end [] we can go from our history and reset to the staging area and checkout the working copy. In this way the flow is a but like hopskotch. Options when you compile your history: github, google code, bit bucket or roll on your own.
